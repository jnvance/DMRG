# Usage

## Example 1: Calculating correlators for a square lattice

A sample source code for a stand-alone executable can be found in src/DMRG-SpinOneHalf-J1J2XYSquare.cpp
[[md](../src/DMRG-SpinOneHalf-J1J2XYSquare.cpp)].

### Compilation

To compile the executable, go to the root directory and execute the command:

    make all

The resulting program is generated in `bin/DMRG-SpinOneHalf-J1J2XYSquare.x`.
For more details see Makefile [[md](../Makefile)]  [[dox](../../Makefile)].
